# Challenger Portal

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/orbitturner/challenger)

Challenger is a group of African developers whose aim is to provide support and lessons to any developer who needs it.
Having been designated as HeadProject and designer I immediately designed the platform (Landing Page) by specifying the graphic charters and the overall visual.
